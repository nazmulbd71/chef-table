                <p className='text-center text-lg mt-6'>Answer : In React Control components are seems to be a parent component and have their state and behavior controlled by the parent component. These components are used as props to pass down from the parent component to update their state and behavior. But the other side we have uncontrolled components that are used to components that manage their own state internally like asynchronously.</p>

After all, I can say that Node JS handles server-side but Express JS is a framework which is handle the response and request.</p>

                <p className='text-center text-lg mt-6'>Answer : The custom hook is a JavaScript Function whose name starts with the use called a hook.
